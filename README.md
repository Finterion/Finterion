with investors. Investors can easily rent bots that match their risk 
preferences and align with their individual 
investment goals. The platform provides a comprehensive set of 
metrics, empowering investors to make informed decisions based 
on clear and measurable data.

Developers can now monetize their bots and earn passive income from 
investors around the world by having their bots listed on Finterionâ€™s Marketplace. 
Most importantly, all code remains completely private, meaning that each 
creator retains full IP rights.

All bots on the Finterion Marketplace must pass a rigorous screening process 
by our evaluation framework. Next to that we track the performance of each bot 
and provide investors with a comprehensive set of metrics, empowering them to
choose the right bot for their investment goals.

### Portfolio tracker ðŸš€
Finterionâ€™s portfolio tracker allows investors to track their crypto portfolio
across multiple exchanges and wallets. The tracker provides investors with
a comprehensive set of metrics, empowering them to have full analysis of their
portfolio.

## How Do Crypto Trading Bots Actually Work?
Trading bots are computer programs that use various indicators to recognize
trends and automatically execute trades.

Trading bots typically consist out of the following processes:

1. Data collection and analysis
2. Buy and sell signal generation through technical analysis
3. Portfolio risk allocation
4. Order execution

These processes are executed in a loop, allowing the bot to continuously
monitor the market and execute trades based on its predefined parameters.

Trading bots come with many advantages, such as:
âœ… Emotionless trading
âœ… Higher trading speeds and market responsiveness
âœ… Complex strategies executed in milliseconds
âœ… Continuous monitoring of the market
âœ… Proven strategies through backtesting and live performance tracking

Finterion allows you to use these bots without having to code them yourself or 
rent-out your own bots to other investors. 

### How do I use a bot?
Finterion provides investors with a dashboard where you can connect your
exchange by using API keys (Application Program Interface). If you have made 
a connection with your exchange, you can rent a bot from the marketplace and
start using it.

You will be opted to create a portfolio and then you can connect a bot to it.
When authorization has been revoked, the bot can no longer access your 
account and trading ceases. You are in full control.
